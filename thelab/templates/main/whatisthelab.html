            This platform started with a simple realization:

                Players & Coaches with experience at high levels often have quite a bit of untapped value. 
                The value is not just in their knowledge of the best ways of training for a sport and then playing (or coaching) it at a high level (or levels). It's also in their experience in recruitment and preparation for the higher level(s) at which they've played or coached.

                As a result, theyâ€™ve got both knowledge (about how to get better) and wisdom (about how to make it to the next level) for the millions of youth athletes who themselves aspire to make it to a higher level.
