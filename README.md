# The Lab

Welcome to **The Lab**‚Äîa dynamic social development platform designed to connect athletes and coaches and enhance sports skill development through collaborative training, tailored drills and feedback, and interactive events. The Lab bridges the gap between sports coaching and modern technology, empowering athletes to train smarter, and enabling coaches to share their expertise effectively and with a wider audience.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**The Lab** hopes to offer a unique space for:

- **Athletes**: Participate in personalized training sessions with successful players and coaches, sign up for group events, and practice with expertly designed drills, receiving expert feedback.
- **Coaches**: Share knowledge through in-person or remote events, as well as instructive video content, and review athlete performance to provide valuable feedback.

and offer key features like:

- **Profiles & Accounts**: Athletes can upgrade to Coach status upon verification of their experience. Profiles with Coach-verified accounts can also create Business Accounts
- **Packages & Events**: Coaches create training packages that Athletes purchase (e.g., $80/hr private training) and subsequently schedule one or events with the coach, either 1-on-1 or as a group. Alternatively, coaches can simply create an Event and the athlete(s) can sign up directly! 
- **Drills & Reviews**: Athletes practice drills shared by coaches, and optionally submit performance videos for manual review‚Äîlaying the groundwork for future AI automation (of the drill review process).
