# The Lab

Welcome to **The Lab**‚Äîa dynamic social development platform designed to connect athletes and coaches to enhance youth skill development. **The Lab** bridges the gap between sports coaching and modern technology, empowering athletes to train smarter and more enjoyably while enabling coaches to share their expertise more effectively and with a wider audience.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**The Lab** hopes to offer a unique space for:

- **Coaches**: Share knowledge through in-person or remote events, as well as instructive video content, and review athlete performance to provide valuable feedback.
- **Athletes**: Participate in personalized training sessions with successful players and coaches, sign up for group events, and practice with expertly designed drills, receiving expert feedback.

**Key Features:**

- **Profiles & Accounts**: Basic users can upgrade to Coach status upon verification of their coaching/playing experience (college-minimum). Coach-verified accounts can also create Business Accounts.
- **Packages & Events**: Coaches create training packages that users can purchase (e.g., $80/hr private training) and subsequently schedule one-on-one sessions or group events. Alternatively, coaches can simply create an Event (like a clinic or camp), and athletes can sign up directly!
